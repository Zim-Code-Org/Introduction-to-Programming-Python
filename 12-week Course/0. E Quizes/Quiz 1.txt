Short Answer Questions [Total: 20]

What are the types of the values on the left? If it is not a valid type, write ERROR [7]
4567	
“345”	
324.423	
5 >= 4	
“Hello”	
true	
None	

Evaluate the following Boolean expressions. If it is not valid, write ERROR[7]
65 < 102	
12 = 12	
“haha” != “kkkk”	
1 or 0	
( 3 == 7//4 ) and ( 3.4 is not 3 )	
True and False	
‘t’ in ‘Time’	

Identify the error in the following code blocks and debug (fix) it. [6]

#1
Print(“Hello World”)									

#2
num = input(“Enter a number”)
print(num + 7)

#3 
print(“123” + 456)

#4
def myfunc(x):
return x + 2

#5
s = “py”
y = s[2]

#6 Why does this not print anything in the script?

def hello():
	print(“Hello”)


Part B: Coding Questions 

For the following questions you are allowed to use a script/shell to test your code but write the answers in the spaces given below.

Shell Questions [4]

Calculate the following quantities in the shell and write the answer. Some of them are not written in Python math! [4]
4(3.4)(7.8)(9.9)	
sin⁡〖(31)〗	
17234 mod 332	
(2*3%4)*((1.4//0.4) + (15 - 3))	

Short Script Problems [4]
Define a function called add2(x,y) that adds 2 numbers x and y and returns the result.[2]

def add2(x,y):
	’’’
	Adds two numbers
	x -> float
	y -> float
	returns float
	’’’






	Define a function called last_char(s) that prints the last character of a string s e.g. last_char(“hello”) should print “o”, last_char(“34”) should print “4”. [2]
def last_char(s):
	’’’
	Prints the last character of the string s
	s -> str
	returns None
’’’





Long Script Problem [12]
You are going to write a script that asks for a user’s first and last name and then prints it in a specific format and tells them how many characters are in their name. Do not panic! It looks long but each step is very short. You do not need to define any functions.
You are allowed to ask for help on any of the questions but you will lose 1 point.
	Create a new script and name it with your first name, last name and school (Remember the rules for naming files) and save it in your folder (e.g. C:/users/zimcode/My Documents/school/name). 
If you cannot do part a) ask for help, you will not be penalized. 
	On the first line of your script write a comment with your name. [1]
	Define/Declare a new variable called first_name and make it input from the user with the question “First name? ”. [1]
	Define/Declare a new variable called last_name and make it input from the user with the question “Last name? ”. [1]
	Replace the old first_name with a new first name that is capitalized. (Hint: Take note of replace which means you must assign the capitalized first name to a variable!) [2]
	Replace the old last_name with a new last name that is all caps (upper case). (Hint: Take note of replace which means you must assign the uppercase last name to a variable!) [2]
	Define a new variable called full_name that is first_name concatenated with last_name with a space in between and print it. e.g. if first_name is Tonde and last_name is Moyo, full_name should “Tonde Moyo” with a space in between.[2]
	Store the length of full_name minus one (for the space) in variable called name_len. e.g. if the full name is “A B”, the length should be 2 not 3. [1]
	Print the statement “Your name has name_len characters” where name_len is the answer from h) (Hint: What type should name_len be for you to concatenate with a string?) [2]

Here are some examples of working code
Example 1
>>> First Name? Tonde
>>> Last Name? Moyo
Tonde MOYO
Your name has 9 characters 
Example 2
>>> First Name? jerry
>>> Last Name? muleya
Jerry MULEYA
Your name has 11 characters 
Example 3
>>> First Name? bABes
>>> Last Name? WodUMo
Babes WODUMO
Your name has 11 characters
