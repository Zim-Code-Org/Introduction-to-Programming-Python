For any lesson, these are the documents that you need:

• Lesson Plan for that Week/Lesson 
• Student’s textbook (See latest version in PDF book folder)
• Tutor's textbook (See latest version in PDF book folder)
• Slides for the day (depending on lesson number)
• Examples, Exercises & Soultions (see Daily Exercises in Exercises folder)
• Homework to be assigned
• Curriculum schedule
• Tutor schedule

*All the materials will be available on the Google Drive, but you are encouraged to print them.

Before the lesson (At least a day before)

1. Read the instructions in the lesson rubric for what you should do to setup.
2. Make sure you have read and understood the topic in the Tutor's textbook, look at the curriculum schedule and make sure you understand what topics are being covered for the next lesson. Communicate with your fellow tutors to make sure you are all on the same page.
3. Look at the exercises in the curriculum guide and write the answers (or get the answer to all the exercises from someone) for the exercises in the Daily Exercises document.
4. Look over the slides if they exist and make sure you understand the material on them.
5. Alert a team member if there are any issues that you can't understand or solve on your own.

During the lesson

1.Use the slides to go through material (The slides are not a replacement for the tutor, they are used to guide you, most of the work should be done in a script/shell)
2. Whenever you see a slide that has an example, look for the example in the Exercises and Examples book and do as many of them as possible live on screen.
3. At the end, tell the students which chapter of the book they should read and ask what they did not understand so that the next tutor can explain it.
4. Generally, be sure to follow the Lesson plan structure for best and consistent results.
